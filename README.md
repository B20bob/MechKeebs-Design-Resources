# MechKeebs-Design-Resources
An ever-evolving list of repos &amp; other resources I use while designing mechanical keyboards.

I would like this to become a sort of one-stop library of resources for everyone in the hobby, from those who are brand new, to those who have been doing it for years.

If you have any resources you would like to add please feel free to submit a PR.
